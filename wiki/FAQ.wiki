=== I login as _root_, but I can't see bandwidth information in database for _root_ user ===

sshband will not count the bandwidth for root user(which uid=0).

=== Why is _sshd_ inserted into username field on my database ===

Check your configuration file whether you config ssh_uid correctly. ssh_uid could be obtaind by the command following: 

{{{
cat /etc/passwd | grep sshd | awk -F ":" '{print $3}'
}}}
